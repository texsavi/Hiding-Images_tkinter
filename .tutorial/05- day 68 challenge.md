# ðŸ‘‰ Day 68 Challenge

For today's challenge, you need your code from Day 67.

1.Start the program with no image displayed.
2. If the user inputs a name that can't be found, a **new** label should appear in the image location saying 'Unable to find image'.

ðŸ¥³ Extra points for getting all the inputs with just one `input` command and the `split` function.

Example:

![](resources/unabletofind.png)

<details> <summary> ðŸ’¡ Hints </summary>
  
- Create the error label in the main program. Just don't pack it so it doesn't show.

- If the image can't be found, hide the canvas and pack the error label.
